###Wind Farm Power Output Forecasting Project

- **Developed and optimized time series forecasting models** using univariate ARIMA to predict wind farm power output, achieving a **4% improvement in RMSE** compared to the baseline persistence model (0.27 vs. 0.31 RMSE).

- **Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a 3-year dataset, identifying data stationarity through **Dickey-Fuller tests** (p-value < 0.05), and verified the absence of trends or seasonality, enabling the use of ARIMA models without differencing.

- **Validated the data integrity and normalization** by checking for gaps and carving out a **4-month validation test set**, ensuring data followed the same pattern as the hold-out set, with 36 hours of available data followed by 48 hours of missing data.

- **Tuned ARIMA model parameters** (AR, I, MA) using Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots, determining an optimal AR(2) model based on **cut-off after 2 lags in PACF** and gradual decay in ACF.

- **Optimized model performance** through a grid search for **AIC, BIC, and RMSE**, balancing model fit and complexity. The ARIMA model achieved optimal AIC/BIC values, while RMSE optimization suggested a simpler AR(1) model, which was carefully evaluated for overfitting.

- **Implemented data preprocessing techniques** including data normalization, and designed the hold-out set with a repeating pattern of missing data to mimic real-world forecasting challenges, enhancing the model's robustness.

- **Improved model interpretability and diagnostics** by analyzing residuals and correlation between lagged residuals, ensuring the model accounted for all dependencies in the data.

- **Integrated interactive widgets into the Jupyter notebook** for real-time model evaluation, using **Voila** to convert notebooks into standalone applications, facilitating stakeholder engagement and model demonstration.

- **Explored advanced machine learning techniques** post-ARIMA analysis to further improve forecasting accuracy, focusing on model scalability and deployment for real-time applications.
